# news--aggregator 
## A news aggregator using Django is a web application that collects news articles from multiple websites and presents them in one location. This type of application typically involves the following components:

### 1.Web Scraping: Using libraries like BeautifulSoup and requests to scrape news articles from various websites. The scraper collects data such as the title, image, and URL of each article.

### 3.Data Storage: Storing the scraped data in a database, here I used MySQL, to manage and retrieve articles efficiently.

### 4.Django Framework: Utilizing Django to build the web application, including models to define the structure of the data, views to handle the logic, and templates to render the data on web pages.

### 5.User Interface: Creating a user-friendly interface that allows users to browse, search, and filter news articles. The interface can be styled using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### 6.Authentication: Implementing user authentication to allow users to log in and personalize their news feed.
